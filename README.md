# encryptedMessageRiddle
<p>
This is a project I wrote for Advanced Computational Linguistics class.
It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a> to decrypt a message.
<br> Here are parts of the instructions given for this project:
<br>A North Korean spy, imprisoned in a local prison in Los Angeles, was caught sending an encrypted
<br>message written using an encryption system known as the Substitution Cipher. That is, each alphabetic
<br>letter is replaced with another letter. Scientists from a local university were the ones to intercept the
<br>message (provided on Piazza as problemset 06 encrypted input.txt), and they ask for your help:
<br>find the encryption key (i.e. letter permutation) used by the spy! Decrypt the message! Save the world!
</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>
  it takes about 4-5 minutes to the program to exacute.
  <br>The program prints the decrypted message, and the dictionary that is needed in order to decrypt it.
